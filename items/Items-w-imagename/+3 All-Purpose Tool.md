Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it.While holding this tool, you gain a +3 bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells.As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don&#39;t know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can&#39;t be used again until the next dawn.
