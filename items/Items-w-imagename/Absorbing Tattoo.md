To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space. Damage Resistance. While the tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance to a type of damage associated with that color, as shown on the table below. The DM chooses the color or determines it randomly.Absorbing Tattood10ColorTattoo1GreenAcid Absorbing Tattoo2BlueCold Absorbing Tattoo3RedFire Absorbing Tattoo4WhiteForce Absorbing Tattoo5YellowLightning Absorbing Tattoo6BlackNecrotic Absorbing Tattoo7VioletPoison Absorbing Tattoo8SilverPsychic Absorbing Tattoo9GoldRadiant Absorbing Tattoo10OrangeThunder Absorbing Tattoo Damage Absorption.
