#  Wreath of the Prism (Dormant)
**Type:** wondrous item

**Rarity:** Legendary
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement
**Source:** EGW
**Properties:**
**Value:** Varies
**Weight:** Varies

**Description:** This loop of golden thorns is inset with dozens of gems representing the five colors of Tiamat. Dormant. While wearing the wreath in its dormant state, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the wreath increases the range of your darkvision by 60 feet.When you hit a beast, dragon, or monstrosity of challenge rating 5 or lower with an attack, or when you grapple it, you can use the wreath to cast dominate monster on the creature (save DC 13). On a successful save, the target is immune to the power of the wreath for 24 hours. On a failure, a shimmering, golden image of the wreath appears as a collar around the target&#39;s neck or as a crown on its head (your choice) until it is no longer charmed by the spell. If you use the wreath to charm a second creature, the first spell immediately ends. When the spell ends, the target knows it was charmed by you.
