#  Wukka Nut
**Type:** adventuring gear

**Rarity:** Unknown
**Attunement:** None Required
**Source:** ToA
**Properties:**
**Value:** 1 gp
**Weight:** Varies

**Description:** These fist-sized nuts grow on wukka trees, which are popular haunts for jaculi, su-monsters, and zorbos. A wukka nut rattles when shaken, causing its shell to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. This magical light fades after 1 minute, but shaking the nut again causes the light to reappear. If the shell of the nut is cracked open, it loses its magic.
