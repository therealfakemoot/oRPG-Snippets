#  Alchemist&#39;s Doom
**Type:** adventuring gear

**Rarity:** Unknown
**Attunement:** None Required
**Source:** SCC
**Properties:**
**Value:** Varies
**Weight:** 1 lb.

**Description:** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist&#39;s doom as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
