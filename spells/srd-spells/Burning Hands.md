**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S
**Range:** Self (15-foot cone)
**Duration:**  Instantaneous
**Description:**
As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



 The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes:**  *Sorcerer, Wizard, *
