> **Ritual**

**Casting Time:** 1 minute
**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)
**Range:** Self
**Duration:**  1 minute
**Description:**
You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.



 Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.



 If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.



**Classes:**  *Cleric, *
