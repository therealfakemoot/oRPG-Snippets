**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Components:** V
**Range:** 30 feet
**Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
**Description:**
You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move into a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, the spell doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn.



 The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.



**Classes:**  *Paladin, *
