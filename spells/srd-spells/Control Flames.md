**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** S
**Range:** 60 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)
**Description:**
* You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.



 * You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.



 * You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.



 * You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.



 If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.



**Classes:**  *Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, *
