**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell.
**Components:** S
**Range:** 60 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous
**Description:**
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.

**Classes:**  *Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, *
