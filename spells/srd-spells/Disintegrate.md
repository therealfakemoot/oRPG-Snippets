> Transmutation  (6)

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)
**Range:** 60 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous
**Description:**
A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by *[wall of force](../wall-of-force/ "wall of force (lvl 5)")*.



 A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.



 A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a *[true resurrection](../true-resurrection/ "true resurrection (lvl 9)")* or a *[wish](../wish/ "wish (lvl 9)")* spell.



 This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.

**Classes:**  *Sorcerer, Wizard, *
