**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S
**Range:** 90 feet
**Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
**Description:**
Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting form a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.



 A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.



 When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
