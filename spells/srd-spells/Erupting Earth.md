**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of obsidian)
**Range:** 120 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous
**Description:**
Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared away. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes:**  *Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, *
