**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S
**Range:** 120 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous
**Description:**
You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the *[alarm](../alarm/ "alarm (lvl 1)")* spell, a *[glyph of warding](../glyph-of-warding/ "glyph of warding (lvl 3)")*, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.



 This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.



**Classes:**  *Cleric, Druid, Ranger, *
