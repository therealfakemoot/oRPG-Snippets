**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
**Range:** 150 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous
**Description:**
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



 The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes:**  *Sorcerer, Wizard, *
