**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S
**Range:** 120 feet
**Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
**Description:**
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes:**  *Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard, *
