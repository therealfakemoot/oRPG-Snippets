**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material)
**Range:** 120 feet
**Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
**Description:**
You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.



 The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.



**Classes:**  *Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, *
