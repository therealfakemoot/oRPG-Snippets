**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
**Range:** 300 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous
**Description:**
A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



 Hailstones turn the stormâ€™s area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes:**  *Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, *
