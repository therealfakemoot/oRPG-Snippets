**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V
**Range:** 90 feet
**Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
**Description:**
Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the spell’s duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can’t be extinguished through nonmagical means.



 If damage from this spell reduces a target to 0 hit points, the target is turned to ash.



**Classes:**  *Sorcerer, Wizard, *
