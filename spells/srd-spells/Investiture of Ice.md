> Transmutation  (6)

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S
**Range:** Self
**Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
**Description:**
* You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.



 * You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.



 * The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.



 * You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.



**Classes:**  *Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, *
