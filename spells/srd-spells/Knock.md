**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V
**Range:** 60 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous
**Description:**
Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.



 A target that is held shut by a mundane lock ar that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.



 If you choose a target that is held shut with *[arcane lock](../arcane-lock/ "arcane lock (lvl 2)")*, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.



 When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.



**Classes:**  *Sorcerer, Wizard, Bard, *
