**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
**Range:** 120 feet
**Duration:**  1 round
**Description:**
You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.



 You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.



**Classes:**  *Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard, *
