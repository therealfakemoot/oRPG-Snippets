**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)

**Description:**
A Passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the Duration. You choose the opening's dimensions - up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The Passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.
