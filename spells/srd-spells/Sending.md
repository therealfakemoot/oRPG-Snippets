**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)
**Range:** Unlimited
**Duration:**  1 round
**Description:**
You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.



 You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesnâ€™t arrive.



**Classes:**  *Bard, Cleric, Wizard, *
