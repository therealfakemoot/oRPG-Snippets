**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** S
**Range:** 30 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)
**Description:**
* You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.



 * You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.



 * You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.



 * You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.



 If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.



**Classes:**  *Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, *
