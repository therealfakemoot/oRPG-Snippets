**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)
**Range:** 60 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous
**Description:**
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a lO-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.



 A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd levei or higher, the damage increases by ld8 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes:**  *Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, *
