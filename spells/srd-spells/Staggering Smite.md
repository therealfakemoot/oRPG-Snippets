**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Components:** V
**Range:** Self
**Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
**Description:**
The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra 4d6 psychic damage to the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions, until the end of its next turn.



**Classes:**  *Paladin, *
