**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S
**Range:** 150 feet
**Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
**Description:**
A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell’s duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere’s space is difficult terrain.



 Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.



 Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases for each of its effects by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes:**  *Sorcerer, Wizard, *
