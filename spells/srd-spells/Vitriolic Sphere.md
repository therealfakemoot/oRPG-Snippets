**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of giant slug bile)
**Range:** 150 feet
**Duration:**  Instantaneous
**Description:**
You point at a place within range, and a glowing 1-foot ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and 5d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes:**  *Sorcerer, Wizard, *
